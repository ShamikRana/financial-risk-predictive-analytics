# Predictive Analytics System for Financial Risk Assessment

This repository contains an end-to-end machine learning system for predicting financial risk (credit default).
The project is developed as part of an MSc Data Science capstone.

## Objectives
- Build and compare ML models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting (LightGBM)
- Perform robust evaluation using business-relevant metrics
- Ensure explainability and reproducibility
- Deploy the final model using FastAPI and Docker

## Tech Stack
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, LightGBM
- SHAP (model explainability)
- FastAPI (model serving)
- Docker (containerization)
